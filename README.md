# GTM to Git

This allows you to pull down HTML from a GTM container and stores it in a local file system so that you can easily push it into git. The idea is to allow you to have better versioning differences and to fit GTM into a normal Peer Review Cycle. Eventually I would like this to be able to work both directions so that you could transpile your code and push it out to GTM.
